# Naive-Bayes-classifier-for-Fake-News-recognition
Fake news are defined by the New York Times as "a made-up story with an intention to deceive", with
the intent to confuse or deceive people. They are everywhere in our daily life, and come especially from
social media platforms and applications in the online world. Being able to distinguish fake contents form
real news is today one of the most serious challenges facing the news industry. Naive Bayes classifiers 
are powerful algorithms that are used for text data analysis and are connected to classification tasks of
text in multiple classes. The goal of the project is to implement a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier in
R and test its performances in the classification of social media posts. The data set is available
on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anmolkumar/fake-news-content-detection?select=train.csv).
